### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
This solo project took roughly 7 days or 20 hours to complete in my 12th week of JS development.

### Contributors:
[//]: <> (Who worked on this application? Link to their GitHubs.)
This application was built by [Seth Way](https://github.com/seth-way).

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
- Use object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation
- Create a clear and accessible user interface
- Make network requests to retrieve data
- Implement a robust testing suite using TDD

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
- In order to deploy this UI to github pages the locally running API also had to be deployed. I worked through this process and tracked my steps in a [public gist](https://gist.github.com/seth-way/674391fa848d484c68320f7aec4acb9d) so that my classmates and myself have access to a working example tutorial.
- The finished product is not only mobile friendly, but also recieved a 100 accessibility score from Google Lighthouse.
